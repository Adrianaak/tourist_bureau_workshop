# Tourist Bureau Workshop

You will build a website for the local visitor's bureau that will help tourists explore all the things to do in the area. If they find an excursion they like, they can buy "e-tickets" directly from the site.

**Be sure to look at previous projects for inspiration**

## Home Page (required)

A home page with informational text/images promoting the town and navigation links
to the other pages. It needs a professional, but minimalistic appearance. Their budget
for this project is tiny!

Requirements: 
- Display a dropdown of the provided categories to the user
    - Add a `<select>` to the `activities.html` with a matching `id` and `name` property
    - In `scripts/activities.js` write code that populates your `<select>` with the data in the categories array. Use the activity name for the `textContent` and `value` for each option you generate.
    - Be Sure to include a default option that says **Select an Activity** with an empty string as it's value.
